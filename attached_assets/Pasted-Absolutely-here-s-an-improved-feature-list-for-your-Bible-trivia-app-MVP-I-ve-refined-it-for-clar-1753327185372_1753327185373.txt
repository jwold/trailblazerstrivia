Absolutely — here’s an improved feature list for your Bible trivia app MVP. I’ve refined it for clarity, completeness, and user-friendliness while keeping it focused on an MVP (minimal viable product). Key enhancements include:

- Adding kid-friendly elements like timers, hints, and optional multiple-choice for easier questions (based on common features in popular apps like Daily Bible Trivia and Bible App for Kids, which use timers and varied formats to boost engagement).
- Expanding question variety with categories and types (e.g., character-based, quotes) to make gameplay more dynamic without overcomplicating curation.
- Incorporating accessibility and encouragement features for 10–12-year-olds, such as audio options and positive feedback.
- Suggesting light API integration for verse references (e.g., via bible-api.com) to automate Bible text pulls, reducing manual work while keeping questions curated.
- Ensuring offline-friendly elements where possible for a web app (e.g., caching questions).
- Streamlining leader controls and adding basic analytics for flagged questions to improve future iterations.

I’ve kept it web-based, no accounts needed, and emphasized the playful theme.
